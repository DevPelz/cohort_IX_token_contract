The `CHTIX` token contract is a Solidity smart contract that implements a transferable token adhering to the ERC-20 standard. It allows token transfers between addresses and includes features like total supply tracking, minting, burning, and approval for spending.

The contract owner can also withdraw Ether from the contract's balance.
